# Welcome to my profile! 👋

I am a something-year-old developer from the US focused on developing a unified platform for Windows.

### [Insert Cool Image Here]

## What I'm Working On
The platform thingy I mentioned (Those who read 🤯)
* Aurevue
* plinth.
* AvX
* Spark*
* Luminance

> Woah, project theming?

Yes. **LIGHT.**

## Things I've Already Done
Uh, nothing. 😭

Well, I had this one silly project called SephirothOS as well as some pathetic attempts at web-blocker bypasses (Oxygen-122, .slate, etc.)

Unfortunately, you can't find these now because the repos for the bypasses are gone, and SephirothOS was finally unplugged from all external APIs and archived in November 2025.

Plus, these projects are all insignificant.

## Socials (Just Discord)

- Oh, and good luck trying to find me anywhere else. I have no username continuity.

### No, I don't have a dog.
