###---INTRODUCTION---###

Hey everyone, I'm oxygen-me.

I'm a student who codes as a hobby.

I am interested in providing (temporary) solutions to web filter issues.

You are welcome to provide project suggestions. Just know I'm not amazing at coding.

I am based in the US and will work on projects for around an hour each day.

Enjoy your stay!
